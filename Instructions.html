    <h3>Siroya Instructions</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>Search a set with the keyboard.</li>
        <li>Press submit and look for the forte name.</li>
        <li>Press download sets and look for the PDF file with the same forte name.</li>
    </ol>
    <h3>David Instructions</h3>
    <p>You can enter your set information in three ways (you can also combine these ways):</p>
    <ol>
        <li>Click the notes. Click a note again to remove its PC.</li>
        <li>Check off the PCs in the integer boxes. Uncheck a box to remove its PC.</li>
        <li>Type the integers in the first text field. When doing so,
            <blockquote>
                <p>- Do not use commas.</p>
                <p>- Use t for 10, e for 11.</p>
                <p>- Type r to reset the text box while typing.</p>
                <p>- Any invalid characters are simply ignored.</p>
            </blockquote>
        </li>
    </ol>
    <p>Hit Enter / Return to start the calculations. Note: Netscape 4.x users should click the first submit button instead of hitting enter.</p>
    <p>If you enter some of your PCs in the text field and then mouse-click the rest, hit Enter / Return (again, Netscape 4.x users should click submit instead) before you start clicking boxes or piano keys. If you don't, only the PCs you've mouse-clicked will be included in the calculations.</p>
    <p>You can also type the Forte name of a set class in the second text field.</p>
    <p>The calculator displays normal form, prime form, interval-class (IC) vector, Forte name, Forte name of Z-mate (if any), and transposition and inversion levels for set invariance.</p>
    <p>The Complement button displays information about your set's complement. The invert button does likewise.</p>
    <p>Pull-down menus allow you to transform a set by Tn and TnI operations, to display its class subsets and supersets of each cardinality, and to construct a matrix.</p>
    <p>*This calculator does normal form from the right not to the left. See Dr. Tucker's explanation from his Introduction to Pitch-Class Set Analysis for further details.</p>
