  <h1>Pepitos Iba a Hacer Pepinos</h1>
  <p>Once upon a time, in a small village nestled between mountains, there lived a mischievous boy named Pepito. Pepito
    was always up to something, and his latest scheme involved growing cucumbers in his backyard.</p>
  <p>He had heard from his grandmother that cucumbers were easy to grow and could fetch a good price at the market.
    Excited by the prospect of making some money, Pepito set out to plant cucumber seeds in his garden.</p>
  <p>Day after day, Pepito tended to his cucumber plants, watering them diligently and ensuring they received plenty of
    sunlight. However, much to his dismay, the cucumbers refused to grow. No matter what Pepito tried, the plants
    remained stubbornly bare.</p>
  <p>Frustrated and desperate, Pepito sought advice from the village elder. The wise old man listened patiently to
    Pepito's tale of woe and then chuckled softly.</p>
  <p>"My dear boy," the elder said, "cucumbers do not grow from seeds alone. They also need love and care. Perhaps if
    you spent less time trying to make them grow and more time nurturing them, you might have better luck."</p>
  <p>Pepito took the elder's words to heart and changed his approach. Instead of focusing solely on the outcome, he
    began to enjoy the process of caring for his cucumber plants. He sang to them, talked to them, and even danced for
    them.</p>
  <p>And lo and behold, before long, Pepito's garden was overflowing with plump, juicy cucumbers. He sold them at the
    market for a handsome price and became the talk of the town.</p>
  <p>From that day forward, Pepito learned an important lesson: sometimes, the greatest rewards come not from what we
    achieve, but from the love and effort we put into our endeavors.</p>

You can enter your set information in three ways (you can also combine these ways):
1. Click the notes. Click a note again to remove its pc.
2. Check off the pcs in the integer boxes. Uncheck a box to remove its pc.
3. Type the integers in the first text field. When doing so,
> Do not use commas.
> Use t for 10, e for 11.
> Type r to reset the text box while typing.
> Any invalid characters are simply ignored.

Hit Enter / Return to start the calculations. Note: Netscape 4.x users should click the first submit button instead of
hitting enter.

If you enter some of your pcs in the text field and then mouse-click the rest, hit Enter / Return (again, Netscape 4.x
users should click submit instead) before you start clicking boxes or piano keys. If you don't, only the pcs you've
mouse-clicked will be included in the calculations.

You can also type the Forte name of a set class in the second text field.

The calculator displays normal form, prime form, interval-class (ic) vector, Forte name, Forte name of Z-mate (if
any), and transposition and inversion levels for set invariance.

The Complement button displays information about your set's complement. The invert button does likewise.

Pull-down menus allow you to transform a set by Tn and TnI operations, to display its class subsets and supersets of
each cardinality, and to construct a matrix.
